               <h4>Top Story - Brad Marchand Fined $10,000 For Tripping Niklas Kronwall</h4>
               <p>Bruins forward Brad Marchand was fined $10,000 USD for a "dangerous trip" on Detroit 
                  defenceman Niklas Kronwall last Tuesday according to the NHL.</p>
               <img class="page-img" src="images/marchand.jpg">
               <p>Kronwall was stopped at the blue-line when Marchand approached him from behind 
                  and slewfooted him, dropping the Detroit defenceman to the ice. Kronwall was not
                  injured on the play, but this not Marchand's first offense.</p>
